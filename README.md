# Data-Driven-Insights-Predictive-Modeling-for-Adidas-Global-Sales
This project contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed using Python to understand data patterns, distributions, and correlations. It includes visualizations and insights that support data-driven decision-making.

**Primary Objectives**

- To analyze Adidas sales performance across different regions, product categories, and retailers to uncover key factors influencing revenue.
- To identify top-performing and underperforming markets/products using data-driven insights.
- To build machine learning models to predict future sales, helping businesses make accurate demand forecasting and inventory decisions.
- To determine the impact of price, region, marketing channels, and product type on overall sales performance.
- To develop a data-driven strategy that helps improve profitability, optimize stock levels, and enhance decision-making.

**Secondary Objectives**

- To compare multiple regression and ensemble learning techniques (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Bagging) and determine the best-performing model using evaluation metrics like RÂ² score and RMSE.
- To apply Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing techniques to improve model accuracy.
- To segment customers/regions using clustering (if applicable) to identify high-value markets.
- To create interactive visual dashboards (Matplotlib/Seaborn/Power BI) to communicate insights effectively.
